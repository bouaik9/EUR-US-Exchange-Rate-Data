# EUR-US-Exchange-Rate-Data
the project appears to involve web scraping historical exchange rate data from a website (x-rates.com) for a specific range of dates. The code iterates over a range of years, months, and days to construct the desired date for each iteration.

For each date, a request is made to the website, and the HTML response is parsed using the Beautiful Soup library. The code attempts to find the rate element on the page and extracts the rate value if found. It then stores the date and rate in a list called results.

After iterating through all the dates, the results list is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis. The DataFrame consists of two columns: 'Date' and 'Rate', representing the date and corresponding exchange rate.

Finally, the DataFrame is saved to an Excel file named 'results.xlsx' using the to_excel() method.

Overall, the project aims to scrape historical exchange rate data and store it in a structured format for further analysis or visualization.
